# JSWebGames
Game development projects with JavaScript  This repository contains two games built with JavaScript. The projects are very basic, with two "Flashy" versions with some advanced CSS applied.
I did a Game Development with JS course on Sololearn, this repo contains the two games I built step by step during the course. Enjoy!
